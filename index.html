                    Hello! I'm Yukesh Kaushik, a driven and passionate individual with a keen interest in technology and innovation. I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering at Sanskaram University, Jhajjar, Haryana, where I'm honing my skills in programming, software development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence. A recent high school graduate from Yaduvanshi Shiksha Niketan, Hansi (Class of 2024), I'm excited to embark on this new chapter of academic and professional growth, and contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving tech landscape.

                    Throughout my academic journey, I've developed a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals, including algorithms, data structures, computer networks, and database management. I'm fascinated by the endless possibilities that technology offers, and I'm eager to explore the latest trends and advancements in areas like machine learning, cloud computing, and cybersecurity.
                    
                    Outside of academics, you can find me exploring my creative side through singing, indulging in friendly gaming competitions, or experimenting with coding projects that bring innovative ideas to life. I'm a strong believer in the power of technology to transform lives, and I'm committed to using my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact in my community and beyond.
                    
                    As a team player, I've had the opportunity to collaborate with peers on various projects, developing essential skills like communication, problem-solving, and time management. I'm excited to continue learning, growing, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of technology.

                    After completing my 12th I am just feeling relaxed for some days . After sometime I start preparation of CUET ( Common University Entrance Exam) . After giving exam I'm just waiting for results.  But that year result of CUET was too much delayed this taught me patience. In this time period my father gave me an idea of taking admission in private University.  After many research and visits to many colleges and University I found Sanskaram University which was perfect for me. Then I took admission in B.tech there and that was the best step of life according to me.

I faced many issues because my school is far away from my hometown but I had to go there for pre-boards, practicals, etc . This has led to a wastage of time but still I managed all these things. I scored an average grade of in my 12th class.

I completed my 1st sem from Yaduvanshi Shiksha Niketan Dhani Mahu but because of some reason I had to go to the another branch of school which was in Hansi. This has a direct impact on my studies. Due to which I face some academic issues . But steadily I managed my studies and scored an average grade in 11th class.

                    I completed my 10th grade also from Yaduvanshi Shiksha Niketan. But this time there is something different. Our school provides different classes to prepare students for qualifying NTSE ( National Talent Search Examination) . There is different section for NTSE students. Fortunately I was part of that section. There I learned much more than a normal 10th grade student. I also get a good grade in my CBSE board exam which was 87%.
